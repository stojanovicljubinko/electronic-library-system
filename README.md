# Electronic library system 
Projects implemented at Sinergija University. Projects implemented at the University of Synergy. The electronic library system is a program for adding, storing, writing and editing, as well as checking the content and words of books, where in addition to books the user can find entertainment in several mini-games.
The program works on the principle of admin / user interface, where access is through a username and password. In the main form we have the implementation of adding a book to the library, along with the accompanying file in the provided formats (for example .pdf, .txt, .docx and others) which will then be processed in the Notepad form. The Notepad form is not only used for editing but also for writing new books that can be added as a file to the library. It also has automatic storage of previously written (or edited) books, and review of all written (or edited) books and deleting them. It has a word reader that calculates the interestingness of the text (book) or the number of different words and their number of duplicates, and sorting them and forming a drop-down list where we can see the most frequent words.
Also, the system offers user profiles for admins / writers / users and offers them interesting content in the form of X Ox, and a quiz from Serbian literature and a funny height calculator.
*Further application development was discontinued by upgrading to a new version of the same application and developing a better user environment.*
